RESTART WARNINGS
1) In the Citadel Servers Game Services on your server. You will see a clock that is labeled Scheduled Tasks. Click this. 
2) Press the plus button next to the refresh to add a new task. 
3) Select Scheduled Console/Rcon Command.
4) Fill out the fields as follows:
    Command to Execute:	say -1 "Server will restart in 30 minutes. Please prepare and save your progress."	
    Name: 30 min warning
    	Type: Daily
    	Start: 5:30pm (30 min before 6pm for me).
    	Recur Every: 1 Days
    	Check Repeat Task
    	Repeat Every: 4 Hours (This will be for servers that’s want to restart every 4 hours)
    	For: 24 Hours
    5) Repeat this for 15, 10, 5, 2 or how ever long before a restart. 



SETUP RCON TO WORK
1) Once you have your commands you will need to go and add your RCON password into your serverDZ.cfg file. I put mine at the bottom of the page. 
2) You can get the RCON port where you see all your IP addresses.

    rconPort = (YOUR PORT HERE);  // Use the correct RCON port here, you might need to confirm this with your server provider.
    rconPassword = "INSERTPASSWORD";  // Replace with your actual RCON password.
    rconIP = "";  // Keep this blank to bind to all IP addresses or specify an IP if required.
    rconMaxPing = 1000;  // Adjust this if players have high ping or to avoid RCON disconnection issues.

3) Go to Activity and Stats on the left and click RCON Client. 
4) Type the password that you put in your file and for the RCON Command do a test: say -1 "Test”
5) If all works you should be good to go with server restarts. It will show you the last time it was executed.
